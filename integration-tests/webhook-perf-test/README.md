# webhook-perf-test application

Dummy application used to act as a webhook application for the cloud events generated by RHOSE.

These events will be triggered by the [hyperfoil framework](https://hyperfoil.io/), used in the integration tests as part RHOSE.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

Once started, you can access the application by hitting the following URL:

```shell script
http://localhost:8080/webhook/events
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
mvn package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
mvn package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
mvn package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/webhook-perf-test-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.

## Creating the Docker image

Before building the container image run:
```shell script
mvn package
```
Then, build the image with:

```shell script
 docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t <TAG_NAME> .
```

Optionally, you can push the image created to any container registry by running the following command:
```shell script
 docker push <TAG_NAME>
```

## Deploying into Minikube
By running the below script, it will first create a new namespace resource named `performance`, then it will build the application
and finally it will deploy it to your minikube cluster under the namespace created earlier:
```shell script
 ./bin/minikube/deploy.sh
```
> **_NOTE:_**  Default webhook-perf-test URL path is /rest/webhook
